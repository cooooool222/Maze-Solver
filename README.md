The Java Maze Solver uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with recursive backtracking to navigate through a 2D character array representing the maze, where 'X' denotes walls, ' ' represents open paths, '+' marks the starting position, '-' is the exit, and '.' indicates visited paths to prevent infinite loops. The maze is loaded from an external file (maze.dat) using file handling with Scanner, and the solver recursively explores each direction (down, up, right, left) while avoiding walls, out-of-bounds errors, and revisited locations. The recursion continues until it either finds the exit or exhausts all possible paths, marking dead ends with '.' to ensure complete traversal.
